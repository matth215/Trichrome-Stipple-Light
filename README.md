# Trichrome-Stipple-Light
Project files for the Stipple Light project I developed for a workshop with Stanford's Lav64 Makerspace. Here you can find build files, instructions, STL models, and arduino code.
BTW: The instructions for this project were made with Lab64 in mind, so if you found these instructions online somewhere, they may not be comprehensive enough to serve as "step-by-step" instuctions. Your results may vary depending on the laser cutter you use, for example. I'll try to add parts and materials to this project when I can.   

## Directory of Files
- (start here) **TSL Preprocessing Guide** describes how to turn your image into a cut file for a laser cutter. This is typically the first step to transform your image!
- **TSL Assembly Guide** shows you how to put everything together, including 3D printing, cutting out your images, and assembly the electronics
- **StippleMount** STL 3D print file ready for making. Print upside down!
- **StippLED Code** This is arduino code that runs on your Metromini V2. Not the best code but it works
- **Trichrome Trotec Template** This is an SVG file for using with the Preprocessing Guide. (Trotec was the brand of the laser cutter we used)
