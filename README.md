# Trichrome-Stipple-Light
Here find my project files for the Stipple Light project I developed as a workshop with Stanford's Lab64 Makerspace. Here you can find build files, instructions, STL models, and arduino code.
The instructions for this project were made with Lab64 in mind, so if you found these instructions online somewhere, they may not be comprehensive enough to serve as "step-by-step" instuctions. Experience with laser cutting, coding, soldering, 3D printing, and general making is highly recommended. Your results may vary depending on the laser cutter you use, for example.   

## Directory of Files
- (start here) **TSL Preprocessing Guide** describes how to turn your image into a cut file for a laser cutter. This is typically the first step to transform your image!
- **TSL Assembly Guide** shows you how to put everything together, including 3D printing, cutting out your images, and assembling the electronics
- **StippleMount** STL 3D file ready for making. Print upside down!
- **StippLED Code** This is arduino code that runs on your Metromini V2. You'll see code versions 2 and 3, although version 3 is cooler.  
- **Trichrome Trotec Template** This is an SVG file for using with the Preprocessing Guide. (Trotec was the brand of the laser cutter we used)
- **Backing** Another SVG file for cutting out the acrylic lid for your stipple mount. This is designed for 1/8" clear acrylic.

## Who to contact
- Me, probably
