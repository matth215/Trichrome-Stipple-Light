# Trichrome-Stipple-Light
Project files for the Stipple Light project I developed for a workshop with Stanford's Lav64 Makerspace. Here you can find build files, instructions, STL models, and arduino code.
BTW: The instructions for this project were made with Lab64 in mind, so if you found these instructions online somewhere, they may not be comprehensive enough to serve as "step-by-step" instuctions. Your results may vary depending on the laser cutter you use, for example. I'll try to add parts and materials to this project when I can.
